A + B : here (A and B are Operands) and (+ is Operator)

prefix : Operator First
postfix : Operator Last

Prefix :
	exp : +ab, *+AB+CD
Postfix :
	exp : ab+,a Ab+CD+*

Infix notation is the notation in which operators come between the required operands. 
Postfix notation is the type of notation in which operator comes after the operand.

Infix: Expressions of format (A + B) are called as infix expressions, these are just like mathematical expressions

Infix expressions are those expressions which have operators between the operands.
Example: A+B

Prefix: An expression is called the prefix expression if the operator appears in the expression before the operands..

Prefix: Expressions wherein the operator comes before the operands are prefix expression like – Infix: (A + B) can be expressed as +AB
Prefix expression is those expressions which have operators before the operands.
Example: +AB.

Postfix: Expression operator comes after the operands are prefix expression like – Infix: (A + B) can be expressed as AB+

In infix form, an operator is written in between two operands. For example: An expression in the form of A * ( B + C ) / D is in infix form.
This expression can be simply decoded as: “Add B and C, then multiply the result by A, and then divide it by D for the final answer.”

Infix expression: The expression of the form a operator b (a + b). When an operator is in-between every pair of operands.
Postfix expression: The expression of the form a b operator (ab+). When an operator is followed by every pair of operands.

Convert Infix to Postfix
	
Convert Infix to Prefix
	1. Reverse the Infix String
	2. Obtain the postfix expression of above the reversed Infix String
	3. Reverse the postfix expression obtained in step 2
