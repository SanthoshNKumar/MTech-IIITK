Rules :

1. Priority of Operators
	- ^   => Highest Priority
	- *,/ => next Priority
	- +,- => lowest Priority

2. No two operators with same priority cannot stay together in the stack column.
	
	ex: Lets say /* , here / is placing on the stack now we placing * but thse two having the same priority.
            in this case before placing the * lets pop / element. 

3. Lowest Priority cannot be placed after highest Priority
	ex : lets say * is alreday there in the stack , now  - is coming be placed on the stack, but * having the highest priority.
	     so before placing -, lets first pop * and place - on the top of the stack.

4. Any operator in between  paranthesis (*) just pop this element(*)
