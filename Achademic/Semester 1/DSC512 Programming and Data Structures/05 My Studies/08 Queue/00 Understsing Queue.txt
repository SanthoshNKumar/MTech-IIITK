A queue in C is basically a linear data structure to store and manipulate the data elements. It follows the order of First In First Out (FIFO).

In queues, the first element entered into the array is the first element to be removed from the array.

For example, letâ€™s consider the scenario of a bus-ticket booking stall.


Applications of Queue Data Structure
	- CPU Scheduling
	- Disk Schedulin
	- Asynchronous data transfer between processors such as File IO, etc.
	- Breadth-First Search Algorithm (BFS)

Enqueue :
	- Putting items in the queue is called enqueue.

Dequeue :
	Removing items from the queue is called dequeue.

Basic Operations of Queue
	- Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
	- Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue
	- IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
	- IsFull: Check if the queue is full
	- Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it

Working of Queue
	- two pointers FRONT and REAR
	- FRONT track the first element of the queue
	- REAR track the last element of the queue
	- Initially, set value of FRONT and REAR to -1

Enqueue Operation
	- check if the queue is full
	- for the first element, set the value of FRONT to 0
	- increase the REAR index by 1
	- add the new element in the position pointed to by REAR

Dequeue Operation
	- check if the queue is empty
	- return the value pointed by FRONT
	- increase the FRONT index by 1
	- for the last element, reset the values of FRONT and REAR to -1

Types of Queues
	- Simple Queue
	- Circular Queue
	- Priority Queue
	- Double Ended Queue

Simple Queue
	- In a simple queue, insertion takes place at the rear and removal occurs at the front. It strictly follows the FIFO (First in First out) rule.

Circular Queue
	- In a circular queue, the last element points to the first element making a circular link.

Priority Queue
	- Here each element is associated with a priority and is served according to its priority. 
	  If elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.

Deque (Double Ended Queue)
	- In a double ended queue, insertion and removal of elements can be performed from either from the front or rear. 
          Thus, it does not follow the FIFO (First In First Out) rule.


List some Queue real-life applications  
	- Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task scheduling etc.
	- In real life scenario, Call Center phone systems uses Queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.
	- Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive i.e First come first served.
