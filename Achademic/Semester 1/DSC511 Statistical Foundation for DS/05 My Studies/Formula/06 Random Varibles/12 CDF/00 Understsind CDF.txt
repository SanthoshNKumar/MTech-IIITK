CDF : Cumulative Distribution Function

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a probability distribution contains the probabilities that a random variable X is less than or equal to X.

In PDF/PMF we are calculating Probability of an random varibale taking the single outcome P(X = x)
example :  what is the probabiliy of single failure,one failure,two failure and so on.

sometime we are interested in group of outcome. means probability of outcome which is collection of outcome.

Example : we are interested in finidng the probability where not more than two failures occured in a peak P(X ≤ 2 )

here, X ≤ 2 which is a union of P(X = 0) ∪ P(X = 1) ∪ P(X = 2)
