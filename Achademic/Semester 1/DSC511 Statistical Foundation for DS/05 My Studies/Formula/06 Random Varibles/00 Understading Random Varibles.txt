A random variable is a rule which assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome of an experiment.

Its a function from sample space to set of called real numbers.
I.e we have sample space, some outcome from sample space mapped to real number.

X : S ---> ‚Ñù

Random Varibale usually written as X

Example: Toss a coin: S = H, T
	Call a head 1 and a tail 0
	S = { 1, 0 }

Example : Tossing coin twice, S = {HH,HT,TH,TT}
	  Here, Let X be random variable that represents number of tails. Then the number of values assume by X are: x = 0,1,2

Types of Random varibales
	- Discrete Random Variable
	- Continuous Random Variable:

Discrete Random Variable:
	- Finite or countable infinite 
	- A random variable is discrete if its values can assume isolated points on the number line.
	- Example : number of telephone calls in an hour.
		    number of jobs arriving for service

Continuous Random Variable:
	- Uncountable infinite 
	- A random variable is continuous if its values can assume all points in a particular interval.
	- Example : Heights, Weights, Lifetime of a component,CPU time,Response time.
