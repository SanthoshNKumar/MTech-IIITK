PDF : Its is the way of representing variables along with its probbaility.
Here, X is event    P(X = x) -> Probability Density function.

Example 01 :

Toss a fair Coin

Rx = {1,0}

** Rx = Range of random variable

Lets say we need to calculate probability of random varible takes 1 P(X =1)
i.e observing a head . in fair coin getting the head and tal has the equivalent property.
so, P(X = 1)= P(X = 0) = 1/2 = 0.5


Example 02 : Tossing Two fair coins, Lets X be the number of heads.

Sample space(S) = {(HH),(TT),(HT),(TH)}

1 = Head; 0 = Tail

P(X = 0) means probbaility of outcome of the events where no heads in the sample space
P(X = 1) means probbaility of outcome of the events where 1 heads in the sample space
P(X = 2) means probbaility of outcome of the events where 2 heads in the sample space

P(X = 0 no head) = {TT} = 1/4 = 0.25
P(X = 1 head) = {(HT),(TH)} = 2/4 = 0.5
P(X = 2 head) = (HH) =  1/4 = 0.25

Always total probbaility is equal to 1
i.e    P(X =0) + P( X = 1) + P(x = 2) = 1
       0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 = 1
