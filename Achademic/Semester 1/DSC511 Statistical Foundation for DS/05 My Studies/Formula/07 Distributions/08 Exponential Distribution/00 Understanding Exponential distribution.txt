It is a continuous probability distribution that often concerns the amount of time until some specific event happens.
The exponential distribution is a probability distribution function that is commonly used to measure the expected time for an event to happen.

For example, the amount of time (beginning now) until an earthquake occurs has an exponential distribution. 

Other examples include the length of time, 
		           in minutes, of long distance business telephone calls, and the amount of time, in months, a car battery lasts.

Difference between the Poisson distribution and exponential distribution?
	- Poisson distribution deals with the number of occurrences of events in a fixed period of time, whereas the exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution 
          that often concerns the amount of time until some specific event happens.

Mean and variance of the exponential distribution?
	- mean =  1/λ; variance =  1/λ2.
	- The lambda represents the rate parameter, and it defines the mean number of events in an interval.
