** Sampling with replacement  : Probability will be same
** Sampling without replacement : Probability will change

The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N.
If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution

The Hypergeometrics distribution,It is used when you want to determine the probability of obtaining a certain number of successes without replacement from a specific sample size.


Binomial (With replacement)
Hypergeometrics (Without replacement)
