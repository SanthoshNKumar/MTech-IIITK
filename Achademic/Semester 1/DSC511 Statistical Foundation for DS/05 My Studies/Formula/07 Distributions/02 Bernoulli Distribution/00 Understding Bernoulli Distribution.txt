The Bernoulli distribution therefore describes events having exactly two outcomes.

Here, An experiment consists of only 2 possible outcomes
ex: Success and Failure; Yes or No; Head or Tail


Example : If you flip a coin 100 times to see how many heads you get, then the Success is getting heads and a Failure is getting tails.
