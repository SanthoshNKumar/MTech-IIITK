Why Normal Approximation to Poission Distribution
	- In Poission distribution formula, the parameter lambda, if the lambda is greater than 20, the poission 
          distribution can be approximated to normal distribution with mean is equal to lambda and variance equal to lambda.

	- Changing discrete distribution to continuous distribution requires continuity factor(+0.5 or -0.5)
