Also called as 'bivariate probability distribution.'

If X and Y are two random variables, then the probability of their simultaneous occurrence can be represented as a 
function called a Joint Probability Distribution or Bivariate Distribution.

Why Joint probability distributions?
Joint probability distributions are useful because we often collect data for two variables (like Sports and Gender) 
and weâ€™re interested in answering questions related to both variables.
