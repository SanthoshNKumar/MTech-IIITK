Why Normal Approximation to Binominal Distribution
- If we look at the binominal probability formula where n is the number of trails.
  when n becomes large, calculations are difficult.
  Ex: Probability of 59 successes in 200 trails, here factorical computation is huge.
  In this kind of situation we can use normal distribution as an approximation to calculate probability.

Conditionss much satisfy
	- Must see 4 requirements of binominal distribution
	- n*p >/ 5 and n*q >/5
		ex: n = 12; p =0.3, and n*p = 3.6 , so do not use normal distribution
	- if 1 and 2 of above met, then a correction for continuity must be applied
	-
