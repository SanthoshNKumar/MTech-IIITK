Probability distribution of number X for the n trails performed until a first success occurs.

The number of times a Bernoulli trial needs to be conducted in order to get the first success after a consecutive number of failures.

Ex: 
1. Probability of getting 1st head in 7th attempt during tossing a coin repeatedly.
2. Tossing a coin repeatedly until the first head appears
3. Shot the target until it hits
4. Give the test until he will pass it.
5. Throwing a die repeatedly until first time a six appears
