An interval estimates for a population parameter is called a confidence Interval.

find Confidence Interval at different scenarios
	1. Confidence interval on mean of a normal distribution with Varianc known (mean (µ),σ2 known)
	2. One Sided Confidence Bounds
	3. Confidence interval for mean (µ) when σ2 is unknown
	4. Large Sample Confidence Interval
