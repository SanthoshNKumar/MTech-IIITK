Point Estimation :  Use of sample data to calculate a single value which is to serve as a "best guess" or "best estimate" of an unknown population parameter.

Types:
  1. Moment Method (MM)
  2. Maximum Likelihood Method(MLE)

Moment Method(MM) :
	- It is a general method where equations for estimating parameters are found by equating population moments with the corresponding sample moments.

Maximum Likelihood Method
